HOW TO MAKE A BUILD

Linux and Windows are the supported operating systems.

for the impatient, here is the short version:

install a lot of packages on your Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

$ sudo apt-get install libreoffice build-essential libgtk-3-dev bison flex checkinstall librsvg2-dev libao-dev \
    libmpg123-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssh2-1-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavresample-dev libavutil-dev \
    libswscale-dev liblzma-dev libxml2-dev git mingw-w64 wine-stable

Clone the judoshiai repository

$ git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/judoshiai/judoshiai judoshiai

setup everything to compile for windows

$ cd judoshiai; ./install-mxe-env.sh
$ wget http://judoshiai.sourceforge.net/win32-gtk3.tgz
$ sudo tar xvzf win32-gtk3.tgz -C /opt

build Software

$ ./build-all.sh

Now follows everything explained in a bit more detail

Development work is done in Linux environment. For Windows users it is recommended
to install VirtualBox + Ubuntu 18.4 LTS for compilation. Learn how to use
Linux terminal and line commands. Everything below after the $ sign 
is typed in a terminal.

LibreOffice is needed for PDF creation. You should already have it,
but if not, get it with the following command:

$ sudo apt-get install libreoffice

"sudo" makes you have temporary root priviledges that are required for 
software installation. "apt-get install" fetches and installs software packages.

Install the basic development tools:

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk-3-dev bison flex checkinstall

You probably already have "build-essential" (compiler, linker). "gnome-devel"
contains everything needed for GTK+ graphical user interface development. 
"bison flex" are used for parsing text. "checkinstall" is required for Debian packages.

Next some libraries:

$ sudo apt-get install librsvg2-dev libao-dev libmpg123-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssh2-1-dev

For judoproxy:

$ sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavresample-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev
$ sudo apt-get install liblzma-dev libxml2-dev

JudoShiai is under GIT in Sourceforge:

$ sudo apt-get install git

If you are behind a proxy you want to edit /home/$USER/.gitconfig

Get the JudoShiai software:

$ git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/judoshiai/judoshiai judoshiai

Change directory:

$ cd judoshiai

Compile:

$ make

Make a Debian package

$ sudo make debian

You can find the result in judoshiai-code/release-linux.

Cross compilation for Windows is done with the M cross environment. in order to set up M cross environment its prerequisits need to be installed

$ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autopoint bash bison bzip2 flex g++ g++-multilib gettext git gperf intltool libc6-dev-i386 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libltdl-dev libssl-dev libtool-bin libxml-parser-perl lzip make openssl p7zip-full patch perl pkg-config python ruby sed unzip wget xz-utils

Now you can setup and precompile the M cross environment

$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/mxe/mxe.git
$ cd ~/mxe
$ make MXE_TARGETS='i686-w64-mingw32.shared x86_64-w64-mingw32.shared' gtk3 curl librsvg libao mpg123 gmp gnutls nettle libgpg_error

for windows XP the software is build using a precompiled mingw from the ubuntu software repositoriy

$ sudo apt-get install mingw-w64

Some programs need Windows emulator to run:

$ sudo apt-get install wine-stable

There exist still lots of required libraries and run time DLL's that are not in
any package. Many DLL's have incompatible versions around and finding the correct one 
may take time. To make life easier you can fetch a ready made set of Windows software.
Get it using command line or your favorite browser:

$ wget http://judoshiai.sourceforge.net/win32-gtk3.tgz

Extract it under the /opt directory:

$ sudo tar xvzf win32-gtk3.tgz -C /opt

Start cross compilation:

$ make TARGETOS=WIN32

Make a package:

$ make setup TARGETOS=WIN32

Result will be in judoshiai-code/release-win32 directory.
Clean everything with commands

$ make clean
and
$ make clean TARGETOS=WIN32
